// Create a functional interface Predicate with an abstract method test with following signature: boolean test(String t); Write a test program to filter all the strings 
present in group of strings which ended with character ‘g’ by using above test method with the help of lambda expression.

Input Format

Your program should take 2 types of inputs. First will represents the number of Strings and second will be the objects of Strings. If the number of strings will be less 
than equal 1 then display the message “Invalid” without asking for any input.

Constraints

Number of strings should be greater than 1

Output Format

Should be list of the strings in separate lines which are ended with character ‘g’
